				<p>My name is Aaron Albonetti and I am a graphic designer based out of Los Angeles, CA. There are many aspects that I love about graphic design, but the main reason I got into this field is because I am truly addicted to learning. A lot of designers describe projects as problems to be solved, but I have never looked at them that way. To me, each project is just a door into a new world that I get to take in, study and ultimately try to represent visually. I walk away from every single project knowing more than when I walked in and that is what keeps me excited. Thanks for checking out my work and feel free to drop me a line at the address below if you want to chat.</p>
